=====================================

<img src="http://phalconist.com/phalconslayer/slayer/default.svg"> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phalconslayer/slayer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phalconslayer/slayer)

Slayer is made to support dependencies while still reaching the speed of Phalcon Framework, it is built with extensive packages such as flysystem, symfony components, swiftmailer, phinx and many more (refer to composer.json)

## Base Framework - Phalcon Framework

Phalcon is an open source, full stack framework for PHP written as a C-extension, optimized for high performance. You donâ€™t need to learn or use the C language, since the functionality is exposed as PHP classes ready for you to use. Phalcon also is loosely coupled, allowing you to use its objects as glue components based on the needs of your application.

Phalcon is not only about performance, our goal is to make it robust, rich in features and easy to use!

## Contributing

When creating a new issue, it should starts with (add, update, remove, change, move and etc.)

If you will be committing, the first word in the title should represent a present particles e.g(adding, updating, removing, changing, moving and etc.)

Every release will be past participles e.g(added, updated, removed, changed, moved and etc.).

Let's have an example,
  - You'll be creating a new issue, you saw some bugs, you must title it to
    - issue#8: __fix the error regarding Foo\Bar handle function__
  - One of our contributors did some update, the commit title must be
    - commit title: __fixing the error regarding issue #8 ...__
  - We consolidated all the commits, and the project lead will be releasing a new version
    - Version <major>.<minor>.<patch>
      - __fixed error regarding issue #8 ... by @<username>__
      - added ...
      - updated ...
      - changed ...
      - etc ...

You can pull the most updated branch ``dev``, create a pull request of your forked branch updates, issues should be reported using GitHub's Issues and all security concerns should be emailed to ``daison12006013@gmail.com`` promptly.
